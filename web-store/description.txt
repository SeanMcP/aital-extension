An extension for keeping track of who is talking during Google Meets

Do you find yourself talking too much during meetings? Or maybe you don't talk enough? Wouldn't it be nice to know when you are dominating the conversation or failed to comment at all?

"Am I Talking A Lot?" provides the solution by keeping a private record of participant talking time in Google Meet meetings.
